    <p>Learn about the steps involved in a routine dental checkup. This article provides insights into what happens during your visit, from initial assessments to professional cleanings and personalized advice.</p>
    <p>A dental checkup is an important part of maintaining oral health. Here’s what you can expect during your visit:</p>
    <h3>1. Initial Examination</h3>
    <p>Your dentist will examine your teeth, gums, and mouth to check for any signs of issues such as cavities, gum disease, or oral cancer.</p>
    <h3>2. Professional Cleaning</h3>
    <p>A dental hygienist will clean your teeth, removing plaque and tartar buildup. This helps prevent cavities and gum disease.</p>
    <h3>3. X-Rays</h3>
    <p>If necessary, your dentist may take X-rays to get a closer look at your teeth and jaw. This helps identify problems that aren’t visible during the examination.</p>
    <h3>4. Discussion and Recommendations</h3>
    <p>Your dentist will discuss their findings and recommend any necessary treatments or follow-up appointments.</p>
    <p>Regular checkups are essential for maintaining a healthy smile. Don’t hesitate to ask your dentist any questions during your visit!</p>
